# products-catalog

This is a repository to practice learning from the Power Sites - (Dev Pleno). An application for a small e-commerce was built, where they render products with images and other information. Pages are created statically using Gatsby and Contentful. 
Maintenance is done by Contentful and the application is updated directly.
Stacks used: React, JavaScript, Gatsby, CSS and Tailwind.
